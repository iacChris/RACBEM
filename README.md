# RAndom Circuit Block Encoded Matrix (RACBEM)  

This is a python module implementing RACBEM using IBM's Qiskit. It can used in various quantum linear algebra problems.

## Getting Started (Oct. 2021)

Because **IBM Qiskit** has experienced significant updates and archarchitectural changes since the original repo was published, we had difficulties running the demo following the original installing instructions. Thanks to Flynn's efforts, we successfully identified the suitable version of `qiskit` to be `0.16.0`. To avoid the similar painful experience in the future, we prepared the updated instructions down below, assuming that you already have `conda` installed.

#### RACBEM Demo

1. `conda create --name=$ENV_NAME python=3.7`

2. `conda activate $ENV_NAME`

3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. `python .\main_test.py`

*Note: we suppressed the annoying `DeprecationWarning` in `main_test.py`*

#### QSPPACK Demo

To run this demo, make sure you have MATLAB and Julia installed. After installing Julia, [install IJulia](https://julialang.github.io/IJulia.jl/stable/manual/installation/#Installing-IJulia) to make it work with Jupyter Notebook. Specifically, you need to run the following commands in Julia terminal.

```bash
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("IJulia")
```

## Dependencies and Installing Instruction (Original)

+ Pyhton3.7, IBM Qiskit, QuTiP, numpy, scipy

+ Installing Instruction:

  1. Install Anaconda for python-package management, avaliable at https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

     Go to the terminal after installing Anaconda.

  2. If you have already had a Python3.7 environment, just skip this step.

     `conda create --name=$ENV_NAME python=3.7 # have the environment use Python 3.7`

     `source activate $ENV_NAME`

  3. Make sure the modules for scientific computing, **numpy, scipy**, are installed.

     `conda install numpy scipy`

     You are also suggested to install **matplotlib** for visualization and **Cython** due to the requirement of QuTiP.

     `conda install matplotlib cython`

  4. Install the package **pickle** to load/save data locally.

     `conda install pickle`

  5. Install **QuTiP**. If the installation is terminated due to missing dependent packages, please check the document provided by QuTiP, http://qutip.org/docs/latest/installation.html

     `conda install qutip`

     If conda doesn't work, try pip for instead.

     `pip install qutip`

     You can also install directly from source if both conda and pip don't work but it's rare. See **Installing from Source** in the document for details. http://qutip.org/docs/latest/installation.html

  6. Install **IBM Qiskit**. See the document for details. https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html

     `pip install qiskit`

  7. In your **python** environment, test whether you successfully install **IBM Qiskit**.

     `python`

     `>>> import qiskit`

     If the module is loaded, the installation is all set.

  8. Run our demo code.

     `python main_test.py`

You are suggested to get and save locally an IBM account which is used frequently when using IBM Qiskit. See **Access IBM Quantum Systems** in the document for details. https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html



## Introduction

This is an implementation of the a RAndom Circuit Block Encoded Matrix (RACBEM) and its Hermitian conjugate. It is then used to build a quantum singular value circuit using the method of quantum singular value transformation (QSVT).

Take a RAndom Circuit Block Encoded Matrix (RACBEM), this function uses a quantum signal processing circuit to evaluate the matrix inverse, using the method of quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). This implements a (non-Hermitian) block-encoding of a Hermitian matrix manually.

## Notice

It's possible to get the following **warning** message when importing **racbem**. It's due to a problem of QuTiP (github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1205). Please just **ignore** it because it doesn't affect the computation.

It may happen in MacOS, Windows or Linux.

## Running the demo

`python main_test.py`

## Generating phase factors using QSPPACK

To implement QSVT, a set of phase factors which characterizes the target function is needed. You can generate phase factors by using **QSPPACK**.

### Installing Instruction:

1. Download the latest source code in our Github repository. https://github.com/qsppack/QSPPACK

2. Go to the directory where you save QSPPACK and run the following command in **Matlab** terminal.

   `>> startup`

### Running the demo:

We provide a demo code to generate phase factors which solve QLSP whose condition number is upper bounded. You can follow the steps below after you set up QSPPACK.

1. Open `Remez.ipynb` in **jupyter notebook**. Make sure you installed **Julia** language. See https://julialang.org for details.

   Run `jupyter notebook` or `LANG=zn jupyter notebook` in terminal under the directory of RACBEM to open the notebook.

2. Run the code in the notebook. A data file `coef_5_6.mat` will apear in your directory. A polynomial approximation is saved in that file.

3. In **Matlab** terminal under the directory of RACBEM, run `>> GeneratePhi(5,6)`. You will get 2 figures, the following messages, and a txt file `phi_inv_5.txt` in which the informations about phase factors are saved.
